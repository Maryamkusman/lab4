# CSE15L Lab Report 4

## links 

 The link of MarkdownParse Repos
 
[mine](https://github.com/Maryamkusman/markdown-parse) 

[reviewed in Wk7](https://github.com/AnniePhan02/CSE15L-Panther.git)

## Snippet 1:
```
`[a link`](url.com)

[another link](`google.com)`

[`cod[e`](google.com)

[`code]`](ucsd.edu)
```
output generated by the CommonMark demo site:

![Image](Screen%20Shot%202022-02-26%20at%205.10.42%20PM.png)

the backticks that are in the front of the link 1 is not according to syntax. All the linked are ok except the first one. so should expect: **[`google.com, google.com, ucsd.edu]**

Turing the snippet into a test case, and saved as `Snippet1.md`
```
 @Test
    public void testSnippet1() throws IOException{
        Path fileName = Path.of("Snippet 1.md");
	    String contents = Files.readString(fileName);
        List<String> expected = List.of("`google.com", "google.com", "ucsd.edu");
        assertEquals(expected, MarkdownParse.getLinks(contents));
    }
```
My implementation of `MarkdownParse.java` fails the test, picking up every link as a valid link:

**Do you think there is a small (<10 lines) code change that will make your program work for snippet 2 and all related cases that nest parentheses, brackets, and escaped brackets? If yes, describe the code change. If not, describe why it would be a more involved change.**

Yes. the backticks need to come together in the outermost bracket.What i did was set a variable as the value of number of backticks of the content in the out brackets. thsi was done witha forloop . this compares the chatacters in the outside brackets with ```, if it is equal, increments the value. 


## Snippet 2:
```
[a [nested link](a.com)](b.com)

[a nested parenthesized url](a.com(()))

[some escaped \[ brackets \]](example.com)
```
output generated by the CommonMark demo site:

![Image](Screen%20Shot%202022-02-26%20at%205.12.38%20PM.png)

the stuff in first bracket is ok syntax for a link. 
Second link works: follows syntax
 the third link works. Thus, we should expect: **[a.com, a.com(()), example.com]**

        assertEquals(expected, MarkdownParse.getLinks(contents));

check if there are nested brackets and nested parenthesis in link. To deal with nested brackets and the nested parenthesis: the content insde the parenthesis in outtermost bracktes get picked and the content inside the outermost parenthesis gets picked. The algorhthm requires multple if else statements.

## Snippet 3:

```
[this title text is really long and takes up more than 
one line

and has some line breaks](
    https://www.twitter.com
)

[this title text is really long and takes up more than 
one line](
    https://ucsd-cse15l-w22.github.io/
)


[this link doesn't have a closing parenthesis](github.com

And there's still some more text after that.

[this link doesn't have a closing parenthesis for a while](https://cse.ucsd.edu/



)

And then there's more text
```

Becasue there can not be an line in [] and (), only the second link is valid, so we should expect: **[https://ucsd-cse15l-w22.github.io/]**

**Do you think there is a small (<10 lines) code change that will make your program work for snippet 2 and all related cases that nest parentheses, brackets, and escaped brackets? If yes, describe the code change. If not, describe why it would be a more involved change.**
No. Since links turn invalid when one or more empty lines are entered in a complete parenthesis or brackets, or the content inside a parentheiss are broken into more than one line, or the closing braket and open parenthesis are seperated by `\n`. The program has to check all the conditions and picks everything inside the complete bracket, which would probably take more than 10 lines of code.
